# Realtime Video Object Detection with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates real-time object detection in videos using [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). It processes all video files from a folder and outputs annotated videos showing detected objects like people, cars, and more.

## Features

- Batch processing: automatically detects and processes all videos in the `videos/` folder.
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8 (`yolov8n.pt` model).
- Outputs saved with bounding boxes in the `outputs/` folder.
- Live visualization while processing (press `q` to quit early).
